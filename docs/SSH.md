----------------------------------------------------------------

:arrow_forward: KEY TAKEAWAYS

- Ubuntu has the latest version of the OpenSSH client installed by default.
- All the tools needed to secure and customize the SSH daemon are built in.
- You can use terminal tools like tmux and screen to log into devices and manage SSH sessions.
- You can use GUI tools like [SecureCRT](https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/), [Termius](https://termius.com/), and putty. See [SSH GUI clients](#ssh-gui-clients)

----------------------------------------------------------------

I highly recommend buying a copy of [SSH Mastery](https://mwl.io/nonfiction/tools#ssh) by Michael Lucas. It’s available at [SSH Mastery](https://mwlucas.gumroad.com/l/CngLH) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) as an ebook for about $10.

When I switched to Linux my only experience with SSH was Putty. Basically just opening putty, putting in an ip address and connecting. I knew that Putty had a separate program, puttygen, to create ssh keys and other functionality but I really just used it to do a simple ssh connection. There is so much more to SSH and Michael explains all of it in SSH Mastery.

For a network engineer the biggest benefit of Ubuntu is that you have an SSH client and server that can be used from the terminal without installing proprietary software. It gets updated automatically when Ubuntu is updated.

As I moved more and more to NetDevOps and started working with Linux servers in the cloud I started to appreciate the benefits of having an ssh client and server integrated with the operating system.

## History of SSH

Secure Shell (SSH) has always been an open source project. It was originally released in 1995 by a Finnish computer scientist Tatu Ylönen. Before SSH, telnet was the most popular remote access protocol but it doesn't support encryption.

OpenSSH was released in 1999 by the [OpenBSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBSD) project. Most network devices supports SSH V1 and V2. V1 has been deprecated and V2 was released in 2006. On network devices if you do a `show ip ssh` command you might see `SSH Enabled - version 1.99` which means both V1 and V2 are enabled. What you want to see is `SSH Enabled - version 2.0` meaning V1 is disabled.

The open source community for ssh and ssl are moving rapidly to drop support for legacy ciphers.

!!! Warning
    Ubuntu 25.04 includes openSSH 9.9p1 which dropped all support for ssh V1! Any device that uses ssh-dss for the Host Key Algorithm will not connect

I upgraded to Ubuntu 25.04 on my laptop because I wanted some features in Gnome 48. The openSSH 9.9p1 update turns out a problem for older network devices like an HPE Procurve 2920, a Cisco IOS-XE device running 3.6.7 or older or a Ubiquiti M5 NanoStation. The reason is they are using ssh-dss for the Host Key Algorithm. This was part of the ssh V1 spec so it is gone.

I tried to recompile openSSH using flags but they were serious and there isn't a way to add ssh-dss back. This means that you cannot open a terminal and ssh to an older network device.

### Work Around for ssh-dss

- You can install putty using `sudo snap install putty` since putty brings legacy crypto with it.
- You can spin up a virtual machine of Ubuntu 24.04 using KVM.

I installed Putty but then realized that I use netmiko and other tools so I had to install a VM. I will glad when ancient network equipment is gone. Just last week (June 2025) a friend texted me that he was at a customer with a working Cisco 4500 running CatOS and Cisco 2926 switches. Gemini couldn't figure out how old these devices were!

### Verifying ssh ciphers

From a terminal you can use:

- ssh -V - Display openSSH version
- ssh -Q HostKeyAlgorithms - Display the Host Key Algorithms supported
- ssh -Q MACs - Display the Message Authentication Code algorithms supported
- ssh -Q KexAlgorithms - Display the Key Exchange Algorithms supported.

I created the following alias since I was checking often and on several machines:

```bash
alias mw-ssh='ssh -V && echo "" && echo HostKeyAlgorithms && ssh -Q HostKeyAlgorithms && echo "" && echo MACs && ssh -Q MACs && echo "" && echo KEXAlgorithms && ssh -Q KexAlgorithms'
```

I preface my custom aliases with "mw" so that I can type `mw-` and hit tab to display them.

This is the output on Ubuntu 25.04

```bash
mw-ssh

### Locating devices with ssh-dss Host Key Algorithms

You can use nmap to quickly scan devices and find those with ssh-dss ciphers.

`nmap -sV -p 22 -oN ssh-dss.nmap --script ssh2-enum-algos 192.168.10.50-254`

The -oN ssh-dss creates a `.nmap` file.

Here is the output from the HPE 2920 in my garage:

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="13"
Nmap scan report for 2920-Garage.pu.pri (192.168.10.52)
Host is up (0.0069s latency).

|       hmac-sha1
|       hmac-md5-96
|   compression_algorithms: (1)
|_      none
```

Since we created the nmap file we can use:

`grep -i '192.168|dss' ssh-dss.nmap` to quickly find all devices.

Here is a sample output:

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="2 4 6"
 2:Nmap scan report for Ubiquiti-ofc.pu.pri (192.168.10.50)
17:|       ssh-dss
28:Nmap scan report for Ubiquiti-garage.pu.pri (192.168.10.51)
43:|       ssh-dss
54:Nmap scan report for 2920-Garage.pu.pri (192.168.10.52)
66:|       ssh-dss
```

As you can see, devices 192.168.10.51-52 are using `ssh-dss` as the Host Key Algorithm. I have my network devices registered in DNS to it's easy to identify them. If you use MS Windows you can easily ask chatGPT to create a PowerShell script to read a spreadsheet of hostnames/IP addresses and create the DNS entries.

The HPE 2920 is running `WB.16.10.0025` firmware which I think is the last release. Here is a `show ip ssh` from the 2920:

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="7"
HP-2920-24G-PoEP# sh ip ssh

  SSH Enabled     : Yes                 Secure Copy Enabled : No
  TCP Port Number : 22                  Timeout (sec)       : 120
  Rekey Enabled   : No                  Rekey Time (min)    : 60
                                        Rekey Volume (KB)   : 1048576
  Host Key Type   : DSA                 Host Key/Curve Size : 1024

  Ciphers : aes256-ctr,aes256-cbc,rijndael-cbc@lysator.liu.se,aes192-ctr,
            aes192-cbc,aes128-ctr,aes128-cbc,3des-cbc
  MACs    : hmac-sha1-96,hmac-md5,hmac-sha1,hmac-md5-96
```

You can see from the ip ssh config that you can change the cipher and the MAC but not the Host Key Algorithm. FYI, HMAC is Hashed Message Authentication Code. All ssh MACs are actually HMACs.

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="2 5"
HP-2920-24G-PoEP(config)# ip ssh

 timeout               Specify the maximum length of time (seconds) permitted for protocol
                       negotiation and authentication.
```

## What Cryptographic Algorithms Should I use

When building a configuration template for a deployment you should remove as many legacy ciphers as possible. As the US CISA pushes for more secure IT infrastructure you will find more customers running security scans after you deploy. It's better to pass a security scan than have to answer questions about why your refresh failed a basic security audit.

Since SSH is almost 30 years old there are a lot of ciphers available. But of course, many are no longer secure. IoT manufactures and network devices typically have a lot of ancient ciphers. Episode 209 of the [2.5 Admins](https://2.5admins.com/2-5-admins-209/) podcast titled: Faulty Defaults is worth listening to if any of this is new to you.

Asking which ciphers are secure is like asking "Is Mac better than Windows?". But here are some general guidelines:

- Don't use any encryption with CBC in the name. For example aes128-cbc. The CBC means `cipher block chaining` and PCI will fail you if it finds it.
- Do use encryption with CTR in the name. For example aes256-ctr.
- Don't use a MAC with SHA1 in the name if possible. For example hmac-sha1
- Do use a MAC with SHA2 in the name. For example hmac-sha2-256 or hmac-sha2-512
- Don't use a Key Exchange Algorithm (KEX) with SHA1 in the name if possible. For example diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
- Don't use a HostKeyAlgorithm with dss in the name. This is an SSH V1 Host key and has been dropped on openSSH 9.9 and above.

You can do a search on the Internet for current algorithms. But, you will find that a lot of network devices don't support modern cryptographic algorithms. Some notable exceptions that support modern ciphers are:

- Aruba CX version 10.07 and newer
- Juniper Junos version 18.2R1.9 or higher
- Cisco IOS version 15.2(7)E2 or higher
- Cisco IOS-XE 17.2.x or later

----------------------------------------------------------------

### How to configure the algorithms

This is not an exhaustive tutorial. It's here to give you an idea of how to configure ssh algorithms for your base template.

Aruba CX

```bash
ssh ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com aes256-ctr aes256-cbc
ssh host-key ed25519
ssh host-key-algorithms ssh-ed25519 ecdsa-sha2-nistp521
ssh key-exchange-algorithms ecdh-sha2-nistp256 curve25519-sha256
 diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256
ssh macs hmac-sha2-256 hmac-sha2-512
ssh public-key-algorithms x509v3-ssh-rsa rsa-sha2-256
ssh maximum-auth-attempts 5
```

The Aruba CX firmware has rock solid cryptographic algorithms out of the box. See the [link](#references-ssh-history) in the references below for the exact algorithms. For a table of ssh server commands, see the [Aruba CX SSH server commands](#aruba-cx-ssh-server-commands) below.

## Connecting to Network Devices

:arrow_forward: KEY TAKEAWAYS

- Ubuntu makes it easy to use SSH from the terminal
- You can create custom entries in the ssh config file for each device if needed
- You can use password authentication or public key authentication with the ssh client
- You can easily create a jump host and secure your network devices even further.

----------------------------------------------------------------

**To connect using ssh:**

- Open the terminal
- Enter the following command.

`ssh mhubbard@192.168.10.253`

Change the username and IP address to fit your device.

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Run network commands remotely

You can run commands remotely on the network device using ssh. For example, to execute `show running-configuration` use:

```c# linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
ssh 192.168.10.253 show run
(mhubbard@192.168.10.253) Password:
DECOM___MCI-KSC-SW1 line 2

Building configuration...

Current configuration : 17541 bytes
!
! Last configuration change at 23:34:18 PDT Thu Jul 4 2024 by mhubbard
! NVRAM config last updated at 16:19:00 PDT Tue Jul 9 2024
.
.
.
end
```

You can also use shell commands to get just what you need. For example, let's say I want to know what `ip ssh` commands are in the running configuration.

```c# linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
ssh 192.168.10.253 show run | grep "ip ssh"
(mhubbard@192.168.10.253) Password:
ip ssh source-interface Vlan10
ip ssh rsa keypair-name SSH-KEYS
ip ssh version 2
ip ssh dh min size 4096
ip ssh server algorithm mac hmac-sha2-256 hmac-sha2-512
ip ssh server algorithm encryption aes256-ctr aes192-ctr aes128-ctr
ip ssh server algorithm kex diffie-hellman-group14-sha1
Connection to 192.168.10.253 closed by remote host.
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Network Devices with legacy ciphers

One problem for a network engineer is that newer versions of the OpenSSH client don’t allow weak crypto by default and most network devices have weak ciphers by default. If you are connecting to network devices from a modern version of Mac/Linux you will probably get an error and the connection will fail. You will have to customize the `~/.ssh/config` file to add the ciphers needed.

This is an example trying to connect to a Cisco 3850 IOS XE switch running 16.12.3a:

```c#
Unable to negotiate with 192.168.10.253 port 22: no matching key exchange method found. Their offer: diffie-hellman-group14-sha1
```

Here is the entry I added to `~/.ssh/config`:

Open the file using `gnome-text-editor ~/.ssh/config` and add the following:

```c# linenums="1"
Host 192.168.10.253
    KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
    MACs +hmac-sha1,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512
    HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
```

You can add an SSH key file and a custom port for ssh if needed:

```c# linenums="1" hl_lines="5 6"
Host 192.168.10.253
    KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
    MACs +hmac-sha1,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512
    HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    Port 45005
```

To use a specific key on the fly:
`ssh -i ~/.ssh/customer1/id_rsa  192.168.10.253`

I have run across network devices that required the ancient `dss` HostKeyAlgorithm. Add that with:
`HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa,ssh-dss`

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Using a wildcard in the config file

If you have 100s or 1000s of devices with legacy crypto it gets painful to create an entry in `~/.ssh/config` for every device. You can use a wildcard in the configuration file that will pass the same configuration to every connection. Keep in mind that the wildcard configuration applies to all devices that match the wildcard, not just network devices.

If you have a dedicated management network, for example, 192.168.10.0/24:

```c# linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
Host 192.168.10.*
    Protocol 2
    KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1
    HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
    MACs +hmac-sha1,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512
    PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa
```

The `+` sign adds the legacy ciphers but leaves the new ciphers in place. So a device that only has legacy ciphers can connect but a new device should still negotiate new ciphers.

You can use the `?` as wildcard placeholders. For example, `192.168.10.??` would match any host address with 2 digits.

You can also put multiple hosts on the same line, separated by spaces.

`host 192.168.10.* 172.16.1.*`

You can use an `*` to cover any hosts. The `~/.ssh/config` file is read top to bottom so you can place this at the bottom and have specific devices defined above it.

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="2"
gnome-text-editor ~/.ssh/config
Host *
    Protocol 2
    KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1
    HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
    MACs +hmac-sha1,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512
    PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa
```

### Create an ssh config file for testing purposes

You can use a different configuration if you want to test changes without modifying `~/.ssh/config`. Use `-F` option, for example:

`ssh -F test-config 192.168.10.253`

### Use a different username for network access

Let's say that your laptop's username is `mhubbard` but the customer uses `vector` on all network devices. You can add the username to your config file:

```c# linenums="1" hl_lines="7"
Host 192.168.10.*
    Protocol 2
    KexAlgorithms +diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1,diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha1
    HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
    MACs +hmac-sha1,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512
    PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa
    User vector
```

Now list the username on my laptop

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="2"
~/.ssh ⌚ 21:33:59
$ whoami
mhubbard
```

Log into the switch and run who:

```c# linenums="1" hl_lines="6"
$ ssh 192.168.10.253
(vector@192.168.10.253) Password:
DECOM___MCI-KSC-SW1 line 2
DECOM___MCI-KSC-SW1#who
    Line       User       Host(s)              Idle       Location
*  2 vty 0     vector     idle                 00:00:00 ubuntu.pu.pri
```

This is very convenient even if you are not using ssh keys.

### Display the configuration that will be used

Using `-G` Causes ssh to print its configuration after evaluating Host and Match blocks and exit. You can review your settings to verify you’re getting what you need.

In this example I removed a lot of detail but you can see the key that will be used, the ciphers, and other important details. The `-G` switch will save you a lot of time preparing you config file.

```C# linenums="1" hl_lines="10 15 16 17 18 19 21 22 23 25 26"

### SSH Jump hosts

A jump host is a device that you connect to and then connect to other devices. This is done to limit administrative access to just the jump host. This is very easy to do with Linux. Spin up an Ubuntu server VM with a NIC that has access to the network devices, hardened per your company security policy and then add `ProxyJump` to the ssh config file.

In this example I have an Ubuntu server at 192.168.10.223:

```c# linenums="1" hl_lines="9"
Host 192.168.10.* !192.168.10.223
        Protocol 2
        HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa,ssh-dss
        MACs hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256
        KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
        PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        AddKeysToAgent yes
        ProxyJump 192.168.10.223
```

The `!192.168.10.223` parameter means `not 192.168.10.223`. Without this entry there would be a loop and the jump would fail.

Now use the - J option:

```c# linenums="1" hl_lines="2"
~/.ssh ⌚ 17:00:00
$ ssh -J mhubbard@192.168.10.223 mhubbard@192.168.10.253
DECOM___MCI-KSC-SW1 line 2

DECOM___MCI-KSC-SW1#
```

None of your keystrokes reach the jump host. The only thing the jump host can see is an encrypted data stream between your client and the destination server.

!!! note
    Keep in mind that if the jump box is down you will not be able to log into the network devices. If you use `ssh -v` you will see these messages:

    - debug1: Reading configuration data /Users/mhubbard/.ssh/config
    - debug1: /Users/mhubbard/.ssh/config line 4: Skipping Host block because of negated match for 192.168.10.223
    - debug1: /Users/mhubbard/.ssh/config line 18: Applying options for *

    You can comment out the ProxyJump 192.168.10.223 line in the configuration with a # symbol until the jump box is back online.

### References Wild Cards

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Debugging SSH connections

You can use the -v switch to debug the SSH connection. You can repeat the v up to 4 times - -vvvv. Each extra v adds more details to the output.

----------------------------------------------------------------

### What crypto does my device support?

On most switches you can use something like `show ip ssh` to get a list of the current ssh ciphers.

Here is an example from the Cisco 3850 in my home lab:

```c# linenums="1" hl_lines="6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15"
ssh 192.168.10.253 show ip ssh

### Checking ciphers with nmap

For devices that don't have `show ip ssh`, like IoT devices, you can use nmap with the built in `ssh-enum-algos` script. This is from the Ubiquiti Nano Station in my home lab.

```c linenums="1" hl_lines="9 16 19 22 25"
sudo nmap -sV --script ssh2-enum-algos 192.168.10.50
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-07-08 16:36 PDT

```

As you can see, it has good crypto like curve 25519 and aes256-ctr but then it also supports rsa-dss and diffie-hellman group1 sha1! Why?

This is an example of why you don't want to use the wildcard in the configuration file. depending on the client you could end up using sha1 instead of sha2 or ssh-dss instead of ssh-rsa.

nmap also has a similar script for checking SSL (TLS) crypto:

```c linenums="1" hl_lines="7 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29"
sudo nmap --script ssl-cert,ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 192.168.10.253

```

For new deployments you should take the time to remove legacy crypto in the switch configuration that you build. Once you decide on the best setup, add it to your base template. This is a best practice and will save you some embarrassment if the customer has a security team. Don't ask me how I know this.

If you have written permission from the network owner, you can use this script to do a quick cipher suite assessment of the existing network devices. I have a python script that creates a menu of nmap scripts for security testing. You can find it [here](https://github.com/rikosintie/nmap-python). The script is easy to use has a lot of nmap goodness for a network engineer.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## SSH GUI Clients

Here are three different GUI SSH clients for Linux.

### Putty

If you are coming from Windows you have probably used Putty. There is a Linux version of putty that is free to use.

#### Installation

You can install putty using the Ubuntu package manager:

`sudo apt-get install -y putty`

```bash
 sudo apt-get install -y putty
[sudo] password for mhubbard:

```

Notice that it's a fairly old version. Tap the Super key and type `putty` to run it. I would not install it, instead use ssh from terminator or purchase Termius/SecureCRT.

### Termius

Termius is a modern SSH client and terminal that works on:

- Windows
- Mac OS
- Linux
- IOS
- Android

Which makes it a great option. I personally use it on all of those except Windows. It syncs to the cloud so no matter what device I am on I have all of my hosts, keys, etc. It also has color coding for most network devices and a lot of themes.

I bought it years ago when it was in beta. It's now a $10.00 per month subscription. I think it's worth $10 per month but you will have to decide for yourself.

#### Installation Termius

go to [download](https://termius.com/download/windows) and select `Download .DEB` then open a terminal and run `sudo dpkg -i Termius.deb`

----------------------------------------------------------------

### SecureCRT

This is the 800lb Gorilla of SSH clients. If your company pays for a license for Windows users, you should be able jump on that plan. If not it's $209 for a three year subscription or $129 for a 1 year subscription.

I have never used SecureCRT so I am just going to put a link to the download here and you can research it yourself.

#### Installation SecureCRT

[SecureCRT Downloads](https://www.vandyke.com/cgi-bin/releases.php?product=securecrt)

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Creating SSH Keys

The OpenSSH client allows you to create custom SSH keys. You can create as many keys as you need. You should think about your security requirements and create SSH keys to fit the requirements. For example, if you work for a VAR or MSP, you may want to create unique keys for each customer. You can create subdirectories for different customers. For example:

`~/.ssh/customer1/`

See the section [Network Devices with legacy ciphers](#network-devices-with-legacy-ciphers) for an example of how to add a key to a device profile.

My current recommended public-key signing algorithm is Dan Bernstein's ED25519. To create a set of keys using ed25519, run the following in the terminal from the ~/.ssh directory:

`ssh-keygen -a 100 -f id_custom_25519 -o -t ed25519 -C "$(whoami)@$(uname -n)-$(date -I)"`

-a 100 Use 100 rounds of pbkdf2 (password based key derivation function 2).

-f name for the key pair.

-o Use the new RFC4716 key format and the use of a modern key derivation function powered by bcrypt.

-t Specifies the type of key to create. The options are:

- dsa (weak)
- ecdsa
- ecdsa‐sk
- ed25519
- ed25519‐sk
- rsa (weak)

dsa and rsa are not good choices as they are deprecated. The keys with -sk at the end are for use with physical Security Keys. See the [Yubico](#yubico-authenticator) topic later in this section for more information.

-C Specifies a comment to be added to the public key to make it easier to identify the key in the authorized_keys file of the server you connect to. This is optional. In the example:

- whoami - The username
- uname -n - The device hostname
- date -I - The year-month-day

Specify a strong passphrase when prompted. The passphrase is required anytime you use the key. If you don’t password protect the key, and an attacker gets access to the keys, they can log into any server you used them on.

Here is what the output of the command should look like:

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="1 5 6 7"
ssh-keygen -a 100 -o -C "$(whoami)@$(uname -n)-$(date -I)" -f id_custom_25519 -t ed25519
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in id_custom_25519
Your public key has been saved in id_custom_25519.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:4alqMRHMO/O91aJjlON2NLOUVcwZ5WLBVpcIaOFKylw mhubbard@1S1K-G5-5587-2024-07-11
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|   o     .o..++==|
|    +   .o   .B+.|
|     o Eo.   oo .|

|     o.o B =     |
|    ..  B o      |
|   ..  o o       |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Here is what the public key looks like with the comment:

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
cat id_custom_25519.pub
       │ File: id_custom_25519.pub
       │ ssh-ed25519·AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAINCnTz475PiCydfW10kXIwPqpRpufeeuicoY9NLUndbt·mhubbard@1S1K-G5-5587-2024-07-11
```

You can see my username (mhubbard), hostname (1S1K-G5-5587) and date at the end.

You can replace any of the variables between the starting `"` and ending `"`. For example instead of hostname you could use `key-4-cisco`:

`"$(whoami)-key4cisco-$(date -I)"`

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="1 4"
ssh-keygen -a 100 -f id_custom_25519  -o  -t ed25519 -C "$(whoami)-key4cisco-$(date -I)"

The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:nDm2hRdFrE7xLV3UxKh1DHEOS1C5Ftm0l/Wtqvb6OgI mhubbard-key4cisco-2024-07-24
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Display the existing keys on Ubuntu

!!! Note "Tip for naming keys"

    I always start my key names wih `id_`. If you don't, you will need to modify the `~/.ssh/id_*` section of the next command.

`for keyfile in ~/.ssh/id_*; do ssh-keygen -l -f "${keyfile}"; done | uniq`

- DSA or RSA 1024 bits: This is a red flag. Unsafe.
- RSA 2048: This is a yellow flag, recommended to change
- RSA 3072/4096: Good, but ED25519 is better!
- ECDSA: depends. Recommended to change
- ED25519: The best choice!

Here is what it looked like on my laptop.

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
for keyfile in ~/.ssh/id_*; do ssh-keygen -l -f "${keyfile}"; done | uniq
256 SHA256:2uWbzS9A/4dI+ZS+bM8f5q6wTqeb8vsBvylvQi5B9dE mhubbard@1S1K-G5-5587-2024-07-08 (ED25519)

```

You can see the comment on the first key.

You can print the file name out by adding a print statement:

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="1 3 5 7 9"
for keyfile in ~/.ssh/id_*.pub; do ssh-keygen -l -f "${keyfile}"; print ${keyfile}; done | uniq

### SSH Key permissions

The private key should have rw permission to only the user. No other users or groups should have any permissions. Use the following to view/set the permissions:

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="1 6"
ls -l

If the permissions are wrong, use the following:

```

Here is the output using keys with 0644 instead of 0600:

## Using the SSH keys

:arrow_forward: KEY TAKEAWAYS

- SSH Keys use Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) instead of usernames/passwords. Keys are more challenging to brute force than passwords.
- Linux servers are very easy to configure to use ssh keys on. The `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <Server_IP>` command copies the public key to the server in one step.
- Hardware Security devices such as Yubico [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/products/security-key/) and the Google [Titan Security Key](https://store.google.com/product/titan_security_key?hl=en-US&pli=1) allow you to store your keys securely and login from any laptop or desktop.
- Many Network Devices (Cisco, Aruba, Juniper, Arista, Ubiquiti, etc.) support ssh key authentication.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have keys created what do you do with them? If you support Linux servers it's very easy to copy the public key to the server. Using a Public/Private key pair instead of a password to authenticate an SSH session is popular on Linux/Unix boxes. If you spin up a Virtual Private server on Digital Ocean or Linode you will want to use keys instead of a username and password.

Digital Ocean, a Virtual Private Server (VPS) provider, has this advice on how you should log into their Droplets:  "you should use public key authentication instead of passwords, if at all possible. This is because SSH keys provide a more secure way of logging in compared to using a password alone. While a password can eventually be cracked with a brute-force attack, SSH keys are nearly impossible to decipher by brute force alone." Plus, it means you never have to type C!$c0 again!

See [Brute Forcing SSH](#brute-forcing-ssh) below for an example of brute forcing ssh with nmap.

----------------------------------------------------------------

### SSH Keys with a Linux server

 Following along with our `id_custom_25519` example and an Ubuntu server at 192.168.10.223:

```c# linenums="1" hl_lines="1 19 22"
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_custom_25519 192.168.10.223
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/home/mhubbard/.ssh/id_custom_25519.pub"
The authenticity of host '192.168.10.223 (192.168.10.223)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:oKfQX+/8lwu3rfP8OMRpAfoeJo8EaOeUZ9kxMQfFNsc.
This host key is known by the following other names/addresses:
    ~/.ssh/known_hosts:186: [hashed name]
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
mhubbard@192.168.10.223's password:

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh '192.168.10.223'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.


~/.ssh ⌚ 13:19:05
$ ssh 192.168.10.223
Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (GNU/Linux 6.8.0-35-generic x86_64)
╭─mhubbard@ubuntu-server ~
╰─$ cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGrwMtnnQo0kfjQVwcWOKx72SgsTB7Qj8FPTyyVwduxn mhubbard@1S1K-G5-5587-2024-07-08
```

You can see how the comment makes the key easy to identify in the authorized_keys file.

Since we created a passphrase for the key we are prompted for the passphrase, then logged in.

### Automatic logins

If you need to have an automated login, you can create a key without a passphrase. The actual connection is still secure, but if you lose control of the private key anyone can use it. It's one of those religious arguments that exit in security circles.

Alternatively, you can add the ssh private key to the ssh agent using the following command:

`ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_custom_ed25519`

You will be prompted for the passphrase.

#### ssh-add switches

You can find all switches using `man ssh-add`. Here I'm listing the more common switches.

- D Deletes all identities from the agent.
- d Deletes the given identities from the agent. The private key files for the identities to be deleted should be listed on the command line.
- K Load resident keys from a FIDO authenticator.
- k When loading keys into or deleting keys from the agent, process plain private keys only, skipping certificates.
- L Lists public key parameters of all identities currently represented by the agent.
- l Lists fingerprints of all identities currently represented by the agent.
- X Unlocks the agent. This asks for a password to unlock.
- x Locks the agent. This asks for a password; the password is required for unlocking the agent. When the agent is locked, it cannot be used for authentication.

Be sure to ask your security team if using the ssh-agent is permitted.

### I get an error when trying to use the key

If the login fails, rerun the ssh command with -vvvv `ssh -vvvv 192.168.10.253`. If you see a debug message `sign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed: agent refused operation` the first time you use the key enter the following:

`ssh-add` to add the default private keys to the ssh agent and

`ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_custom_ed25519` to add our custom key.

You can view the keys in the agent using:

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
ssh-add -l
4096 SHA256:0WF9uxNBCPeeHzMAGsYJy2wrsOXNrhPxJ+3lp2PxI+E mhubbard@1S1K-G5-5587-2024-07-11 (RSA)
4096 SHA256:569SKPB/kLsw1DqVlSV4J+bE+NYUDfY/LHNbvjvRs+o mhubbard@vectorusa.com (RSA)
```

For the first key you can see the size, 4096 bits, the fingerprint, the label we used when creating the key and the type (RSA).

----------------------------------------------------------------

### SSH Keys with github

Github doesn't accept username/password for repositories any longer. You will need to use a key pair and configure git to use it. I created a key pair just for github named id_github. To add it to your global git configuration:

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="2 5"
add the key
git config --global user.signingkey ~/.ssh/id_github.pub

Display the user settings in the ~/.gitconfig file
git config --global --list
user.name=rikosintie
user.email=michael.hubbard999@gmail.com
user.signingkey=/home/mhubbard/.ssh/id_github.pub
```

Once you have the key configured in the ~/.gitconfig file you will need log into github.com, settings, SSH and GPG keys, and click "New SSH key".

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Using SSH keys with network devices

First off why would you want to use ssh keys on switches/routers/etc? With large customers you typically use Cisco ISE, Aruba Clearpass or Microsoft Network Policy Server (NPS) and authenticate to Microsoft AD.

But with smaller customers you may not have these infrastructure services available. Using SSH keys on switches/routers/etc when ISE, Clearpass or NPS isn't available is better than using local users and passwords. In this situation, over time,  the customer will usually have several different usernames and passwords across different switches and it can be a nightmare to log into all the switches.

They may not even have the credentials for all devices. In that case, you may want to use the nmap ssh-brute script. See [Brute Forcing SSH](#brute-forcing-ssh) below for an example of brute forcing ssh with nmap.

If you add your public key to the network devices before deploying, at least you will be able to log in efficiently without wasting time trying different passwords. You can also give the private key to the customer and they can import it into Putty.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Using SSH keys with a Cisco IOS switch

Unfortunately it's not quite as easy to enable key based login on network devices but it's just a process. You can include it in your basic security template for example and automate it.

I'm using a WS-C3850-48U running 16.12.3a CAT3K_CAA-UNIVERSALK9 for this example.

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Configure a Time Server

Accurate time is required to use ssh keys. The first step is to configure a time server.

```c#
no ntp allow mode control 3
ntp server ip time-b.nist.gov
ntp server 192.168.10.222 prefer
```

The `no ntp allow mode control 3` is a Cisco recommended best practice to prevent DOS attacks.

- ntp allow mode control 3 --> causes the device to respond to mode 6 packet with a delay of 3 seconds, hence rate limiting and being considered not vulnerable (recommended)

#### Check NTP server config with nmap

nmap has two built in scripts for checking the NTP server configuration.

```c#
sudo nmap -sU -p 123 -n --script=ntp-monlist  192.168.10.253
sudo nmap -sU -p 123 --script ntp-info 192.168.10.253
```

The first one is for verifying that your ntp server doesn't support the "Monitor List" command that led to serious DDoS attacks back in 2014. Here I ran it against the ntp server on the Cisco 3850:

```c# linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
sudo nmap -sU -p 123 -n --script=ntp-monlist  192.168.10.253
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-07-12 13:50 PDT
Nmap scan report for 192.168.10.253
Host is up (0.0052s latency).

PORT    STATE SERVICE
123/udp open  ntp
MAC Address: F8:7B:20:34:A3:C6 (Cisco Systems)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.34 seconds
```

Notice the only output is that the port is open. If the switch supported "monitor list" it would have returned a list of devices that have requested time.

The second is very useful when you are having time issues. You can run it against the configured time server and see if you get response. I have an alias setup for this script:

```c# linenums="1" hl_lines="2"
#Run the nmap ntp-info script. $1 is the ip of the ntp server.
alias mw-ntp='(){sudo nmap -sU -p 123 --script ntp-info $1}'
mw-ntp 192.168.10.253
```

Here I ran it against my Cisco 3850 after I configured it for time.

```c# linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
sudo nmap -sU -p 123 --script ntp-info 192.168.10.253
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-07-12 13:50 PDT
Nmap scan report for 3850.pu.pri (192.168.10.253)
Host is up (0.0032s latency).

PORT    STATE SERVICE
123/udp open  ntp
| ntp-info:

MAC Address: F8:7B:20:34:A3:C6 (Cisco Systems)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 10.35 seconds
```

To verify that the switch is syncing with the ntp server I configured:

```c# linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
show ntp association

  address         ref clock       st   when   poll reach  delay  offset   disp

 * sys.peer, # selected, + candidate, - outlyer, x falseticker, ~ configured
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Add a Domain Name, create the key, set SSH v2

To enable ssh on the switch you have to create an SSH key pair. I used a modulus of 4096, the maximum. It took 113 seconds to generate!  We will copy our RSA public key to the switch's pubkey-chain in the next section. That public key will be used with our private key to secure the SSH session.

```bash
ip domain name pu.pri
crypto key generate rsa modulus 4096 exportable label RSA-SSH-Key
ip ssh version 2
ip ssh rsa keypair-name RSA-SSH-Key !associate keys to SSH
```

!!! Note "Optional but informational"

    The "exportable" parameter. This isn't required but I wanted to point that out that you can make the keys exportable. It's not so important in this case but if you have setup GetVPN on a router you absolutely want to export the keys used for the tunnels. If you don't and the router fails you will have to touch EVERY tunnel once you replace the hardware. If you have exported the keys you just reload them on the new hardware and call it a day.

----------------------------------------------------------------

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

```

Copy the key stating at `BEGIN PUBLIC KEY` until `END PRIVATE KEY`, save it to a file and store it in a secure place.

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Configure AAA authentication

The aaa new-model command causes the local username and password on the router to be used in the absence of other AAA statements. Once you enter "aaa new-model" you will not be able to enter "login local" on vty line configuration. If you had login local configured it will be removed.

When you create the username be sure to include a secret. If you don't, anyone will be able to login with just the username. As always, create a strong secret and use a password manager to store it.

```c#
(config)#username mhubbard privilege 15 algorithm-type scrypt secret ^8(nn-!#who
(config)#aaa new-model
(config)#aaa authentication login default local
(config)#aaa authorization exec default local
(Authentication through the line password is not possible with SSH)
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

#### Configure the vty lines

```bash
(config)#line vty 0 4
(config-line)#transport input ssh
(config-line)#logging sync (prevents console messages from interfering with your inputs)
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Add your PUBLIC key to the device

Open the public key file you created earlier in a text editor (not a word processor). Copy the text between the comments. If you generated a 2048/4096 bit key you will need to break it into smaller pieces or you may see "%SSH: Failed to decode the Key Value" when you exit. I break it into 100 characters per line.

```text linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
gnome-text-editor id_rsa.pub
break the lines into lengths of 100 characters
copy the text after ssh-rsa till the comment begins.
close the key file but do not save it
```

**Paste the key into the device**

```bash  linenums="1" hl_lines="1 2 3 12 13"
(config)#ip ssh pubkey-chain
(conf-ssh-pubkey)#username mhubbard
(conf-ssh-pubkey-user)#key-string
(conf-ssh-pubkey-data)#AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQDhgWxFej4ybQHAEtMHo9gYL6zU5t7HeQE0vy3IFONK9JFsM0HSoxZPK18nh26

(conf-ssh-pubkey-data)#g9QIk4RSWAfpKt+TqB5R+iBCpWYoQ==
(conf-ssh-pubkey-data)#exit
(conf-ssh-pubkey-user)#end

```

Make sure to press `enter` after `key-string` before you paste the key in. You have to use `exit` to end the key-string input. Then use `end` to exit configuration mode.

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Verify the ssh configuration

```bash  linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
show run | sec ssh
ip ssh source-interface Vlan10
ip ssh rsa keypair-name RSA-SSH-Key
ip ssh logging events
ip ssh version 2
ip ssh dh min size 4096
ip ssh pubkey-chain
  username mhubbard
   key-hash ssh-rsa 5D24EA1D261C1836E437F4E67E2CEBEB
   key-hash ssh-rsa CCA79DBB37A7EA060C781DA2767509C0
ip ssh server algorithm mac hmac-sha2-256 hmac-sha2-512
ip ssh server algorithm encryption aes256-ctr aes192-ctr aes128-ctr
ip ssh server algorithm kex diffie-hellman-group14-sha1
 transport input ssh
 transport output ssh
```

!!! Note "Use the hash for setting up the rest of the switches"

    You can use the HASH instead of the key for the next devices you setup. Instead of using "Key-string" in the ip ssh pubkey-chain statement use `key-hash ssh-rsa 5D24EA1D261C1836E437F4E67E2CEBEB`.

If you need to remove a key use the `no` keyword with the key-hash keyword. I needed to remove the old 2096 bit RSA key after I changed the `ip ssh dh min key size` to 4096.

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="3"
ip ssh pubkey-chain
username mhubbard
no key-hash ssh-rsa 4682578A0267D583568FCDCD1229B62C
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Login using the SSH Keys

Continuing in the theme of network devices having legacy crypto, you will have to add `PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa` to the `~/.ssh/config` file for the host.

`ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 192.168.10.253`

Remember that you can add -vvvv to the command to get verbose debugging. I had to do that because the key was failing. In the debugs I saw `send_pubkey_test: no mutual signature algorithm` which reminded me to add  `PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa` to the config file for this host.

You can also use `ssh 192.168.10.253` and the SSH client will try all the keys. I prefer to explicitly call the key, but it doesn't matter if you don't.

Here is the complete configuration and debug to log into the Cisco 3850 using the id_rsa key:

```c# linenums="1" hl_lines="1 10 16"
gnome-text-editor ~/.ssh/config
Host 192.168.10.253
        Protocol 2
        HostKeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa,ssh-dss
        MACs hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha2-256
        KexAlgorithms diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256,diffie-hellman-group14-sha1,diffie-hellman-group1-sha1
        PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes +ssh-rsa
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

ssh -vvvv 192.168.10.253
Next authentication method: publickey

receive packet: type 52
Authenticated to 192.168.10.253 ([192.168.10.253]:22) using "publickey".
```

Once you have entered the passphrase it will be added to the ssh agent and you won't be prompted again until you close the terminal and open a new one. If you want to remove the key from the agent without closing the terminal use:

`ssh-add -D ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

If you want to change the password on the key use:

`ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa`

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Using keys with Putty

If you want to connect from a Windows computer with Putty I have a blog with a tutorial on how to create keys and connect using putty/puttygen - [Authenticating to Cisco devices using SSH and your RSA Public Key](https://mwhubbard.blogspot.com/2015/07/authenticating-to-cisco-devices-using_92.html).

#### Can users still login who don't have keys configured?

Yes, the key-chain must be configured for each user.

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
sh run | sec pubkey
ip ssh pubkey-chain
  username mhubbard
   key-hash ssh-rsa 5D24EA1D261C1836E437F4E67E2CEBEB
   key-hash ssh-rsa CCA79DBB37A7EA060C781DA2767509C0
```

Here are the users I have configured on this switch:

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
show run | sec user
username thubbard privilege 15 secret 9 $9$95tTO1OC4HNmIE$bt1Z4.7aw/EBUQHl3NmLUNMacw4hRPI.742Kbs2r4jA
username mhubbard privilege 15 secret 9 $9$y4j0lAgHcDtV3.$sH6LI79G3qmdpVdICokss8dzjGUC3u7we4.wcPnwNQ.
  username mhubbard
   key-hash ssh-rsa 5D24EA1D261C1836E437F4E67E2CEBEB
   key-hash ssh-rsa CCA79DBB37A7EA060C781DA2767509C0
```

You can see that `thubbard` has to use a password but `mhubbard` can use a password or SSH keys. User `mhubbard` has two keys listed because I generated keys on my Ubuntu machine and my M1 MacBook Air. I could have copied my private key from Ubuntu to the MacBook but I wanted to show two keys.

!!! Note

    IOS only allows two keys in the key-chain.

You can see in the ouput the user's secret is hashed as type 9. In Cisco speak that is scrypt. Scrypt is a `memory` hard hash so having hardware GPUs doesn't speed up reversing the hash. To create a users with scrypt:

`username thubbard privilege 15 algorithm-type scrypt secret Sup3rS3cr3t`

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Using the keys with a JunOS switch

Setting up the JunOS switch is similar to setting up the Cisco switch.

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
ssh -i ~/.ssh/juniper_ed25519_key root@192.168.10.162
Authorized access only! Violators will be violated!
Enter passphrase for key '/home/mhubbard/.ssh/juniper_ed25519_key':
Last login: Fri Jul 12 14:01:28 2024 from 192.168.10.143
--- JUNOS 18.2R1.9 Kernel 64-bit  JNPR-11.0-20180614.6c3f819_buil
root@TEST-Router:~ #
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

## Using the keys with an Aruba CX switch

The Aruba CX switches are easy to set up for SSH and public key access. They support strong cipher suites and it's easy to reset the cipher suite if you remove some and your client can't connect. I personally think they set the standard for how the SSH server implementation should be done on network devices.

### Initial setup

In the Cisco section above we configured NTP, and the user accounts before setting up SSH. You need to do the same for the Aruba CX.

You need to decide which VRF to enable the server on. In this example, we will use the mgmt vrf. Use the following command to enable the ssh server:

```bash
ssh server vrf mgmt
```

When an SSH server is enabled on a VRF for the first time, host-keys are generated. Keeping with the "Aruba sets the standard for ssh" theme, the default RSA key is 4096 bits!

!!! note

    If the host-key of the given type exists, a warning message is displayed with a request to overwrite the previous host-key with the new key.

    That isn't a problem as far as setting up ssh, but keep in mind that if you have connected before, the client will complain that the key has changed.

If that happens you will see the following message:

```bash linenums='1' hl_lines='1'
ssh 192.168.10.233
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the ED25519 key sent by the remote host is
SHA256:fImGI4bZxLw7eRKZ1Sz5PJPLVGy...J3W4.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /home/mhubbard/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending RSA key in /home/mhubbard/.ssh/known_hosts:200
  remove with:
  ssh-keygen -f "/home/mhubbard/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "192.168.10.233"
Host key for 192.168.10.233 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
Host key verification failed.
```

You can copy/paste the following into the terminal to remove the old host:

```bash linenums='1'
ssh-keygen -f "/home/mhubbard/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "192.168.10.233"
```

On macOS you don't get the command to delete the old key but it does give you the line number in the `~/.ssh/config` file that you need to delete.

### Viewing the host-keys

```bash linenums='1' hl_lines='1 8'
show ssh host-key ?
  ecdsa    Show SSH server ECDSA host-key.
  ed25519  Show SSH server ED25519 host-key.
  rsa      Show SSH server RSA host-key.

```

### List the enabled auth methods

Before adding our public key check to make sure publickey authentication is enabled. Public Key Authentication is enabled by default.

```bash linenums='1' hl_lines='1'
show ssh authentication-method
 SSH publickey authentication  : Enabled
 SSH password authentication   : Enabled
 SSH two factor authentication : Disabled
```

Public key authentication can be enabled/disabled using the following:

```bash linenums='1' hl_lines='1'
no ssh public-key-authentication
ssh public-key-authentication
```

### Add your public key

This is where the Aruba shines! You need to display the public key on your laptop and copy it to the clipboard. In the [Creating SSH Keys](#creating-ssh-keys) section we created id_custom_25519, you can use the following commands to view that public key on your computer and copy it to the Aruba:

```bash linenums='1' hl_lines='1'
gnome-text-editor id_custom_25519.pub
CX-10-10(config)# user mhubbard authorized-key ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1...FC8 mhubbard@HP8600-2328.local-2024-07-08
end
write mem
```

### View the public key

In this example, I have copied the public keys from my Linux and Mac laptops:

```bash linenums='1' hl_lines='1'
CX-10-10# show user mhubbard authorized-key

1. ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5...uxn mhubbard@1S1K-G5-5587-2024-07-08

2. Key Type : ED25519
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NT...KFC8 mhubbard@HP8600-2328.local-2024-07-08
```

That's all that's needed to setup pulic key login on the Aruba CX switches!

### List logged in users

I logged into the switch from my Linux and Mac laptops:

```text linenums='1' hl_lines='1'
show ssh server sessions all-vrfs

SSH sessions on VRF default :
    IPv4 SSH Sessions :
        Server IP        : 192.168.10.233
        Client IP        : 192.168.10.106
        Client Port      : 64407

        Server IP        : 192.168.10.233
        Client IP        : 192.168.10.130
        Client Port      : 42954

    IPv6 SSH Sessions :
        IPv6 session does not exist.
```

### Configure Key Exchange

The default key exchange algorithms are good but `diffie-hellman-group14-sha1` is available. Since I'm using Ubuntu 24.04 and this switch is in my lab I changed the algorithms using the following. Notice that no comma is used between the algorithms.:

```bash linenums='1' hl_lines='1'
ssh key-exchange-algorithms curve25519-sha256 curve25519-sha256@libssh.org ecdh-sha2-nistp256 ecdh-sha2-nistp384`
```

### Configure MACs

MAC stands for  message authentication code. In SSH it's actually HMAC, or Hash Message Authentication code. The default MACs are good but it does include `hmac-sha1` which is weak. Since I'm using Ubuntu 24.04 and this switch is in my lab I changed the MACs using the following. Notice that no comma is used between the macs.:

```bash linenums='1' hl_lines='1'
ssh macs hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com hmac-sha2-256 hmac-sha2-512
```

### Configure the Public Key Algorithms

Again, the default public key algorithms are good but it does include ssh-rsa with is weak.  Since I'm using Ubuntu 24.04 and this switch is in my lab I changed the MACs using the following. I shortened the list substantially, and I really would just use the ssh-ed-25519 if I had all modern clients in my organization. Notice that no comma is used between the algorithms.:

```bash linenums='1' hl_lines='1'
ssh public-key-algorithms rsa-sha2-512 ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 ecdsa-sha2-nistp384 ecdsa-sha2-nistp521 ssh-ed25519
```

### Final SSH ciphers

Here is what the final ssh server configuration looks like. Notice that Aruba doesn't even offer ssh v1, version 2 has been available since 2006. I have no ideas why Cisco and others still ship it.

```bash linenums='1' hl_lines='1'
CX-10-10# show ssh server

SSH server configuration on VRF default :

    IP Version        : IPv4 and IPv6        SSH Version          : 2.0
    TCP Port          : 22                   Grace Timeout (sec)  : 60
    Max Auth Attempts : 6

    Ciphers:
    chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com, aes128-ctr, aes192-ctr, aes256-ctr,
    aes128-gcm@openssh.com, aes256-gcm@openssh.com

    Host Key Algorithms:
    ssh-ed25519, ecdsa-sha2-nistp521

    Key Exchange Algorithms:
    curve25519-sha256, curve25519-sha256@libssh.org, ecdh-sha2-nistp256,
    ecdh-sha2-nistp384

    MACs:
    hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com, hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,
    hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com, hmac-sha2-256, hmac-sha2-512

    Public Key Algorithms:
    rsa-sha2-512, ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,
    ssh-ed25519
```

### Reset cipher suites

You can reset individual cipher components or run all of these to get back to factory default settings.

```bash linenums='1' hl_lines='1'
no ssh ciphers
no host-key-algorithms
no key-exchange-algorithms
no ssh macs
no ssh public-key-algorithms
```

## Colorizing the ssh output

There is a github project called chromaterm that allows you to colorize the linux `screen` command which allows you to use a USB serial cable with color. Unfortunately that project was discontinued in 2022. It is still available on github if you want to try it out [chromaterm](https://github.com/hSaria/ChromaTerm)

Luckily a new project is available called chromaterm-- and works great with the latest version of Ubuntu. Here is the link [chromaterm--](https://github.com/Houseman303/ChromaTerm--)

On macOS, it's available from brew using `brew install hSaria/tap/chromaterm`

For Ubuntu we will clone the repository and install it. I have a directory 04_tools that I use for networking tools. You should make a directory for tools, cd into it and then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hSaria/ChromaTerm--.git
cd ChromaTerm--/src/
./configure
sudo make install
```

Copy the chromatermrc config file into ~/.chromatermrc. The configuration is written in Perl Compatable Regular Expression v2. You can test new regexes using [Regex101](https://regex101.com/). Set the FLAVOUR to PCRE2 (PHP >=7.3).

You can also use chatGPT to help you create new regexes. Just tell it you need PCRE v2 regexes and it will create a regex. It will probably be an interative deal to get the regex just right.

I found a good starting configuration file [here](https://gist.github.com/vista-/88c90110dd320be4c78da4f55783b41a) and then added several Cisco IOS XE regexes.

My config file is at [Ubuntu4NetworkEngineers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rikosintie/Ubuntu4NetworkEngineers/main/.chromatermrc). You can click on the linnk, and copy it. Save it to `~/.chromatermrc`

You can use chromaterm with a lot of Linux commands, to use it with ssh simply pipe the output to ct.

`ssh 192.168.10.253 | ct`

Here is an [asciinema recording](https://asciinema.org/a/670211) of chromaterm-- in action.

## The OpenSSH Server

:arrow_forward: KEY TAKEAWAYS

- OpenSSH is a powerful collection of tools for remotely controlling networked computers and transferring data between them.
- OpenSSH includes SCP so you can copy files to and from a network device.
- OpenSSH can use passwords or public keys to authenticate.

Ubuntu comes with an SSH client. If you want to be able to ssh back into your laptop or send files to network devices using SCP you need to install and configure the OpenSSH server. Run these commands to enable the SSH server:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssh-server
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Useful SSH system commands

- sudo systemctl start ssh - Start the SSH server
- sudo systemctl stop ssh - Stop the SSH server
- systemctl status ssh - Show server status
- sudo systemctl disable ssh – disables SSH server after next reboot
- sudo systemctl enable ssh – enables SSH after the next reboot.

Example with OpenSSH installed but not started:

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
 systemctl status ssh
○ ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; disabled; preset: enabled)
    Drop-In: /etc/systemd/system/ssh.service.d
             └─00-socket.conf
     Active: inactive (dead)
TriggeredBy: ● ssh.socket
       Docs: man:sshd(8)
             man:sshd_config(5)
```

Notice the Active status is `inactive (dead)`.

Example with OpenSSH installed and started:

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="1 3"
sudo systemctl start ssh

systemctl status ssh
● ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; disabled; preset: enabled)
    Drop-In: /etc/systemd/system/ssh.service.d
             └─00-socket.conf
     Active: active (running) since Mon 2024-07-15 09:38:12 PDT; 4s ago
TriggeredBy: ● ssh.socket
       Docs: man:sshd(8)
             man:sshd_config(5)
    Process: 3410496 ExecStartPre=/usr/sbin/sshd -t (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 3410497 (sshd)
      Tasks: 1 (limit: 38055)
     Memory: 1.4M
        CPU: 28ms
     CGroup: /system.slice/ssh.service
             └─3410497 "sshd: /usr/sbin/sshd -D [listener] 0 of 10-100 startups"

Jul 15 09:38:12 1S1K-G5-5587 systemd[1]: Starting ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server...

Jul 15 09:38:12 1S1K-G5-5587 systemd[1]: Started ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server.
```

Notice the Active status is `active (running) since Mon 2024-07-15 09:38:12 PDT; 4s ago`

You can see the daemon starting, listening on port 22, and then the status of the daemon changes to `Started ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server`

I don't use the `sudo systemctl enable ssh` command because I don't need SSH running all the time. I start and stop it as needed for added security.

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Edit the OpenSSH configuration file

The OpenSSH server configuration file is located at `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`. To edit the configuration file use the following command:

`sudo nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config` to edit in the terminal
or
`sudo gnome-text-editor /etc/ssh/ssh_config` if you want a GUI

Tip:
Before editing the configuration file, you should make a copy of the original /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and protect it from writing so you will have the original settings as a reference and to reuse as necessary. You can do this with the following commands:

```bash
    sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.original
    sudo chmod a-w /etc/ssh/sshd_config.original
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Check the OpenSSH server version

To check the version of the OpenSSH daemon installed:

```text linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
sshd -V
OpenSSH_9.3, OpenSSL 3.0.10 1 Aug 2023
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Open the SSH port on the Firewall

If you need to have a switch connect to your laptop to copy files over SCP or you want to ssh back into the laptop you will need to allow SSH through the firewall.

The following command will allow SSH through the firewall from any IP address.
`sudo ufw allow 22/tcp comment 'Open port ssh tcp port 22'`

If you want to lock down to a specific IP and subnet, in this example the host 192.168.10.100 and subnet 192.168.20.0/24:

```c#
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.10.100 to any port 22
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.20.0/24 to any port 22 proto tcp
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Verify the UFW firewall configuration

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
sudo ufw status numbered
[sudo] password for mhubbard:
Status: active

     To                         Action      From
     --                         ------      ----
[ 1] 514/udp                    ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 2] 1716:1764/tcp              ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 3] 1716:1764/udp              ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 4] 514/udp (v6)               ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
[ 5] 1716:1764/tcp (v6)         ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
[ 6] 1716:1764/udp (v6)         ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
```

You can see that I have an IPv6 stack running. I use IPv6 in my home lab. I also have the syslog daemon installed on port 514 and I use GSConnect to communicate with my iPhone and Android phone on ports 1716-1764. Obviously I don't have a rule for SSH so let's add a UFW rule allowing SSH from any address.

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="1 5"
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp comment 'Open ssh tcp port 22'
Rule added
Rule added (v6)

sudo ufw status numbered
Status: active

     To                         Action      From
     --                         ------      ----
[ 1] 514/udp                    ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 2] 1716:1764/tcp              ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 3] 1716:1764/udp              ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 4] 22/tcp                     ALLOW IN    Anywhere                   # Open port ssh tcp port 22
[ 5] 514/udp (v6)               ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
[ 6] 1716:1764/tcp (v6)         ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
[ 7] 1716:1764/udp (v6)         ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
[ 8] 22/tcp (v6)                ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)              # Open port ssh tcp port 22
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

### When finished with SSH

You can either disable SSH and remove the rule or just disable SSH if you use it on a regular basis.

From the output above ssh is on lines 4 and 8. Once rule 4 is deleted, rule 8 will become rule 7!

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="1 7 13"
sudo ufw delete 4
Deleting:
 allow 22/tcp comment 'Open port ssh tcp port 22'
Proceed with operation (y|n)? y
Rule deleted

sudo ufw delete 7
Deleting:
 allow 22/tcp comment 'Open port ssh tcp port 22'
Proceed with operation (y|n)? y
Rule deleted (v6)

sudo ufw status numbered
Status: active

     To                         Action      From
     --                         ------      ----
[ 1] 514/udp                    ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 2] 1716:1764/tcp              ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 3] 1716:1764/udp              ALLOW IN    Anywhere
[ 4] 514/udp (v6)               ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
[ 5] 1716:1764/tcp (v6)         ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
[ 6] 1716:1764/udp (v6)         ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
```

----------------------------------------------------------------

### An alias to start ssh and add the UFW rule

```bash linenums="1" hl_lines="2"
# start the ssh daemon and display the status
alias mw-ssh='sudo systemctl start ssh && sudo ufw allow 22/tcp comment "Open ssh tcp port 22" && sudo systemctl status ssh && sudo ufw status numbered'

## Brute Forcing SSH

I mentioned in the creating ssh keys section that usernames and passwords are easier to brute-force than keys are. You can use nmap to brute force ssh. In this example I created a file named users.lst and a file named pass.lst with valid user and passwords for the switch.

Obviously an attacker would be using a breach list or a social engineered list of names and passwords. But for demo purposes I didn't want to spend hours running nmap. I have a list of all the passwords that customers have given me over the years that I use in real situations.

I have had to use this method more than once at small school districts and other customers that don't have ISE or Clearpass and have used local creds. I also had to use this once at a Community College that had the network team arrested!

This should make it clear that you should set a limit on the number of login attempts!

```c# linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
nmap -p 22 --script ssh-brute --script-args userdb=./users.lst,passdb=./pass.lst 192.168.10.253

## Apendix A - IOS-XE CIPHERS

- From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10, the Secure Shell Version 1.99 is not supported.
- From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.10, the minimum RSA key pair size must be 2048 bits.
- From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.11, if you want to continue using the weak RSA key, disable CSDL compliance on the device using the `crypto engine compliance shield disable` command, and reboot.

### Secure Shell Version 2

The configuration for the SSH Version 2 server is similar to the configuration for SSH Version 1. The ip ssh version command defines the SSH version to be configured. If you do not configure this command, SSH by default runs in compatibility mode; that is, both SSH Version 1 and SSH Version 2 connections are honored.

The `ip ssh rsa keypair-name` command enables an SSH connection using the Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA) keys that you have configured. Previously, SSH was linked to the first RSA keys that were generated (that is, SSH was enabled when the first RSA key pair was generated). This behavior still exists, but by using the `ip ssh rsa keypair-name` command, you can overcome this behavior.

If you configure the `ip ssh rsa keypair-name` command with a key pair name, SSH is enabled if the key pair exists or SSH will be enabled if the key pair is generated later. If you use this command to enable SSH, you are not forced to configure a hostname and a domain name, which was required in SSH Version 1 of the Cisco software.
