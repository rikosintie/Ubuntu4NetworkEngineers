By default, Nala will download 3 packages per unique mirror in your sources.list file. Opening multiple connections to the same mirror is great for speeding up downloading many small packages. We have the 3 connections per mirror limit to minimize how hard we are hitting mirrors. Additionally, we alternate downloads between the available mirrors to improve download speeds even further. If a mirror fails for whatever reason, we just try the next until all defined mirrors are exhausted.</p> <p>Note: Nala does not use APT for package downloading and verification</p> <p>Fetch</p> <p><code>sudo nala fetch</code></p> <p>Which brings us to the next standout feature, nala fetch. Nala fetch will check if your distribution is either Debian or Ubuntu. Nala will then go get all the mirrors from the respective master list. Once done we test the latency and score each mirror. Nala will choose the fastest 3 mirrors (configurable) and write them to a file.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>At the moment fetch will only work on Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives still tied to the main repos.</p> <p>History</p> <p><code>nala history</code></p> <p>The last big feature is the nala history command.</p> <p>Nala stores each  <code>Install</code>, <code>Remove</code> or <code>Upgrade</code> in <code>/var/lib/nala/history.json</code> with a unique <code>&lt;ID&gt;</code> number. At any time you can call <code>nala history</code> to print a summary of every transaction ever made.

This annoys some users. Here is how to add Asterisks.</p> <p>Ubuntu provides a terminal tool called <code>visudo</code> to modify the <code>/etc/sudoers</code> file. This tool is a safety blanket that will catch a lot of mistakes when you try to exit. If you bork the file bad enough the system won't log in! Digital Ocean has a tutorial on editing the sudoers file.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Never edit this file with a normal text editor! Always use the visudo command instead! Because improper syntax in the /etc/sudoers file can leave you with a broken system where it is impossible to obtain elevated privileges, it is important to use the visudo command to edit the file.</p> <p>The <code>visudo</code> command opens a text editor like normal, but it validates the syntax of the file upon saving. This prevents configuration errors from blocking sudo operations, which may be your only way of obtaining root privileges.</p> <p>Traditionally, visudo opens the /etc/sudoers file with the vi text editor. Ubuntu, however, has configured visudo to use the nano text editor instead. Before running <code>visudo</code> use the following command to verify what editor will be used:</p> <pre><code>sudo update-alternatives --config editor\n[sudo] password for mhubbard:\nThere are 9 choices for the alternative editor (providing /usr/bin/editor).\n\n  Selection    Path                Priority   Status\n------------------------------------------------------------\n* 0            /usr/bin/joe         70        auto mode\n  1            /bin/ed             -100       manual mode\n  2            /bin/nano            40        manual mode\n  3            /usr/bin/jmacs       50        manual mode\n  4            /usr/bin/joe         70        manual mode\n  5            /usr/bin/jpico       50        manual mode\n  6            /usr/bin/jstar       50        manual mode\n  7            /usr/bin/rjoe        25        manual mode\n  8            /usr/bin/vim.basic   30        manual mode\n  9            /usr/bin/vim.tiny    15        manual mode\n\nPress &lt;enter&gt; to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:\n</code></pre> <p>You can see that I changed the default to the <code>joe editor</code>.

Joe easily handles that but it uses non-standard keys for save, exit, etc.</p> <p>I suggest leaving <code>nano</code> as the default if you are new to Ubuntu.</p> <p>Open the sudoers file with visudo</p> <pre><code>sudo visudo\n</code></pre> <p>Scroll down till you see <code>Defaults        env_reset</code> and add <code>,pwfeedback</code>.

There is no concept of drive letters in Linux. The Linux file system is based on the \u201cFile system Hierarchy Standard\u201d maintained by the Linux Foundation.</p> <p>The top of the Linux file system is called the root. All files and directories are referenced from the root, even if they are stored on different physical or virtual devices. That is so different from Windows that it will take some time to get comfortable with.</p> <p>Here is a link to a great tutorial on the Linux file system by Abhishek Prakash - Linux Directory Structure Explained for Beginners. His tutorial will get you up to speed on the Linux file system. Abhishek creates Linux tutorials and I recommend that you sign up for his newsletter. The subscribe button is at the top of the page.</p> <p>On Windows you have drive letters and the root of the file system is the \u201c\\\u201d character \u2013 The good old C:. But Linux/Mac, or any *NIX for that matter, doesn\u2019t use drive letters. The file system is usually described as a tree with root at the beginning. Root is shown in the file system as /. Everything is then displayed off the root. The \u201c/\u201d is another difference that will take a while to get used to. Unix/Linux/Mac use a forward slash instead of the backslash \u201c\\\u201d for file system commands. When you use a web browser, you use the forward slash for file commands \u2013 https://github.com/rikosintie for example.</p>"},{"location":"Ch01-Using-Ubuntu/#lsblk","title":"LSBLK","text":"<p>For a quick look at block devices (hard drives, thumb drives, nvme, etc.) on the system, you can use the \"list block devices\" command - lsblk. Here is an lsblk listing on my Dell laptop which has an m.2 NVME drive with the OS on it and 1TB SSD for data.</p> <pre><code>$ lsblk -e7\nNAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS\nsda           8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk /media/mhubbard/Data\nnvme0n1     259:0    0 465.8G  0 disk\n\u251c\u2500nvme0n1p1 259:1    0 513.1M  0 part /boot/efi\n\u2514\u2500nvme0n1p2 259:2    0 465.3G  0 part /\n</code></pre> <p>Notice that I included -e7 on the end of the <code>lsblk</code> command. That is because Ubuntu uses \"snaps\" for a lot of applications and the show up as \"loop\" devices in lsblk. The -e means exclude and 7 is the number loop devices.</p> <p>So you can see that I have an NVME drive called nvme01n1. There are two partitions on the nvme drive:</p> <ul> <li>nvme01n1p1</li> <li>nvme01n1p2</li> </ul> <p>P1 is the boot partition and p2 has the operating system. Notice that nvme0n1p2 is type partition and mount is /. That means nvme0n1p2 is the root of the file system.</p> <p>There is also a \"block device\" named sda. This is a 1TB SATA SSD drive and it's mounted at /media/mhubbard/Data off the root.</p> <p></p> <p>The display needs a little explanation. For the disk labeled \u201cUbuntu\u201d it says 45.4 GB / 490.6 GB available. That actually means it\u2019s a 490.6GB drive with 45.4GB available.</p> <p>Once you get used to it, this seems more intuitive and easier to scale than the drive letter model used by Windows. You will also notice in the lsblk output that Linux/Mac, and again all *NIX systems, use the forward slash as a delimiter rather than the backslash.</p> <p>Linux has many \u201cls\u201d commands for listing things:</p> <ul> <li>lsblk \u2013 list block level devices like disk drives, thumb drives, etc.</li> <li>lspci \u2013 list the PCI bus devices on the system</li> <li>lsusb \u2013 list USB bus devices</li> <li>lsof \u2013 list open files</li> <li>lslogins \u2013 list logins</li> <li>lsmod \u2013 list the status of modules inserted into the kernel</li> </ul> <p>I will cover each of these a later in this section.</p> <p>To list the commands that start with \"ls\" you can type ls and press [tab].

The first question is should I just spin up a virtual machine or use bare metal? I used Linux for a few years as a VM before I bought dedicated hardware.</p> <p>The advantage of using a VM is that if you damage it or decide for any reason it\u2019s not the right distribution you can just delete it and try another one. A drawback of using a VM is that you will have to manually map usb devices from the host to the VM. This isn't a big deal, it just makes troubleshooting USB devices a bit more complicated.</p> <p>My suggestion, if you have never touched Linux, is to install Ubuntu as a VM and get some experience with it. You won\u2019t have to spend any money, Ubuntu is free, although I usually donate $10 when I download it to install on a fresh machine, and you can run any of the tools in this book.</p> <p>I have Ubuntu running on a System76 Gazelle from 2016 and a Dell G5 5587 laptop from 2018. I did this because I wanted to get my Linux certifications and I felt that I needed to be running Linux on my daily driver to learn. Using a VM can perform almost anything the bare metal can. However, when I encountered an issue,  I often just shut it down and returned to Windows rather than solving it. Running on bare metal removed the temptation to do that!</p> <p>There are a lot of good tutorials on installing Ubuntu available on the Internet, so I am not going to cover it here.

Like everything else when switching to Linux, it will feel quite different than using VMware Workstation at first. But once you spend a couple days KVM and create a few virtual machines I think you will like it.</p> <p>Plus, VMware is always way behind the Linux kernel so you have to resort to running the updates from vmwware host modules after you update Ubuntu. It's an ugly situation.</p> <p>By default KVM creates virtual machines on a NATed interface with a dhcp address in the range of 192.168.122.2-.254. The linux package dnsmasq is used to provide the DNS/DHCP services. NAT enables connected guests to use the host physical machine IP address for communication to any external network.</p> <p>The <code>default</code> network interface is <code>virbr0</code> and using <code>ip address device show virbr0</code> looks like this:</p> <pre><code>ip address show device virbr0\n20: virbr0: &lt;NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default qlen 1000\n    link/ether 52:54:00:b5:48:b1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n    inet 192.168.122.1/24 brd 192.168.122.255 scope global virbr0\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p>As with VMware, you can create a bridge interface so that the virtual machine has an ip address on the same network as the host.

Most network devices supports SSH V1 and V2. V1 has been deprecated and V2 was released in 2006. On network devices if you do a <code>show ip ssh</code> command you might see <code>SSH Enabled - version 1.99</code> which means both V1 and V2 are enabled.
